# Save As Closed

This extension will add a "Closed" option to Publisher's _Save As_ menu on the entry publish page. If "Closed" is chosen as the save option it will update ExpressionEngine's native status for the entry to "closed", thus removing it from the site and behaviing like a normal closed entry, however, it will save the entry's content as a Draft in Publisher.

Think of this as a "Save entry as draft and close it" option.
